         <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
         <p class="preview-text">
          This paper describes the approach taken by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to develop a framework and indicators to measure the impact of health research. The development process included national and international consultations. Key methodology challenges and measurement requirements were identified. The framework that has resulted from this process includes definitions of key concepts, methodology guidelines, identification of the different stakeholders for impact information and the individual concerns of each stakeholder group. Indicators are classified within five categories that encompass a broad range of impacts. Sources of information and issues in attributing research impacts are discussed. An analysis of issues suggests that impact measurement and performance measurement are complementary activities, with the former focused on broad impacts of the health research sector and the latter on the degree of success achieved by funding agencies in contributing to the process of knowledge development and uptake.

         <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
         <p class="preview-text"> 
          Accountability and value received for the use of public funds have become high priorities for governments around the world. Quantifying the value of publicly funded health research is a challenge for many countries. This paper describes the approach taken by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Canada’s national health research funding agency, to develop a framework to measure the impact of its investments in health research and to begin to identify robust indicators that can be used to establish benchmarks and track progress through time.
         </p>
         
        <h4>Background and Development of the Framework</h4>

        <p class="preview-text"> 

          While CIHR now regularly evaluates its individual programs and has documented the benefits of individual CIHR-funded research projects, there has not yet been any comprehensive or overall assessment of their outcomes in terms of scientific, social and economic impacts. In early 2005, CIHR convened a group of international and Canadian experts to review the present state of knowledge about measuring the impact of health research and to provide advice on the creation of a conceptual framework. The framework that resulted from this process was vetted at a consensus conference of high- level stakeholders in May, 2005. The framework identifies the key expected impacts of health research as well as a set of preliminary indicators and processes for evaluating impact. It includes dimensions that address the concerns of identified stakeholder groups and identifies potential sources of information.
          </p>


        <h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p class="preview-text"> 
          It is feasible to develop indicators to measure the impacts of health research and health research funding. A conceptual framework is important to identify the stakeholders who require impact information and understand the nature of evidence that will be appropriate for each stakeholder group. Indicators can then be identified within this framework.

The framework developed by CIHR facilitates the identification of areas where specific initiatives can be evaluated to identify impacts and areas where a more nuanced approach is required. In broad areas, particularly health impacts and economic benefits, the most promising approach to impact measurement will be to measure the value to society of innovations in prevention or treatment. Often, credit for breakthroughs will be shared by many researchers and by those who support them, including the institutions in which they operate and the agencies that fund their work. Funding agencies, such as CIHR, can demonstrate that they have played an integral part in success by assuming a leadership role in encouraging appropriate research, by recognizing the potential of discovery in its early stages and by undertaking and encouraging the ongoing assessment of impacts. This approach brings together impact measurement and performance evaluation.

National and International collaboration between agencies and organizations that have stakes in health research and national statistical and evaluation agencies are the most promising route to continue the development and population of a robust and credible suite of indicators.

This paper has emphasized the complex challenges in devising credible approaches to the measurement of both impact and performance.  This complexity means that no single approach will satisfy all stakeholders or be sufficient to cover all the activities of an agency with a broad mandate, such as CIHR. Nevertheless, as a publicly funded organization, we have an obvious and clear responsibility to demonstrate both high performance and high impact in everything that we do.
