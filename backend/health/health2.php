         <p class="preview-text"> 
          All facilities must calculate allowable customer occupancy by dividing the room size or available floor space by 500 square feet per person.  
          <p> - The minimum 500 square feet per person occupancy must be calculated and enforced by the facility for every room in a facility where indoor fitness and training occurs. Each room where indoor fitness and training occurs must be monitored to ensure the 500 square feet per person maximum occupancy is not exceeded. 
        </p>
        <p>
