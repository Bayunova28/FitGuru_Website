         <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
         <p class="preview-text">
          Bone undergoes continuous remodeling; therefore, an adequate supply of amino acid and mineral substrate is needed to support the formation and maintenance of bone across the life span. Although a considerable amount of research has been given to the type and amount of dietary protein intake necessary to achieve optimal bone health, authoritative bodies have varying recommendations around intake, largely established on nonbone health outcomes and/or early nitrogen-balance studies. The relationship of dietary protein intake and bone health has sparked intense debate for many decades, and there are inconsistencies in how healthcare providers counsel patients about protein in relation to bone health and prevention of osteoporosis. However, a recent series of investigations from various researches and leading bone health societies have contradicted these early hypotheses and led to a clearer understanding of the role dietary protein plays in optimizing bone health across the life span. This article reviews the existing evidence to date and summarizes a recent webinar cohosted by the American Society for Nutrition and American Bone Health

         <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
         <p class="preview-text"> 
          Dietary protein is the major structural component of all cells (including bone cells) in the body. Proteins function as enzymes, in membranes, as transport carriers, and as hormones, and their component amino acids serve as precursors for nucleic acids, hormones, vitamins, and other important molecules. Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) for protein and amino acids were established by the National Academy of Medicine in 2005, using the available nitrogen-balance studies as a proxy for protein synthesis. The Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) was calculated using this methodology to be the average minimal amount of protein (nitrogen) intake to maintain nitrogen equilibrium. In theory, if intake matches excretion, there will be no change in protein levels in the body over time. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) was calculated as 2 SDs above the EAR to be 0.8 g of good-quality protein (ie, balanced in all 9 essential amino acids) per kilogram of body weight per day for adult men and women (0.85 g/kg per day for children). The National Academy of Medicine also defined an acceptable macronutrient distribution range or range of intake for a particular energy source that is associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease, while providing intakes of all essential nutrients, for protein to be 10% to 35% of total calories per day. While the upper range for total protein in the diet as a percent of total energy intake was set to no more than 35% to decrease risk of chronic disease, there were insufficient data to provide dose-response relationships to establish a tolerable upper intake level for total protein or for any of the amino acids

        <h4>How Much Protein Does the US Population Consume?
        </h4>

        <p class="preview-text"> 
          The US Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming a mixed-protein diet, consisting of high-quality animal and plant-based foods.13 The percent of men who consume less than the current EAR has been shown to be low (<3%) using estimates from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–2004 data sets. Although most age/sex groups appear to consume more protein than their respective EAR, a portion of adolescent females (7.7%) and older women (7.2%–8.6%) report consuming protein levels below the current EAR,14 which may lead to insufficient protein intake to maintain musculoskeletal health. However, there is no significant difference in protein intake as percent energy intake among adults of all ages (Figure 1).15 There is a trend toward decreased protein intake with advancing age. Protein intake averaged 56 ± 14 g/d in young children, increased to a high of 91 ± 22 g/d in adults aged 19 to 30 years, and decreased to 66 ± 17 g/d in the elderly. The median intake of protein on a percentage of calories basis ranged from 13.4% in children aged 4 to 8 years to 16.0% in men aged 51 to 70 years. Even the 95th percentile of protein intake did not approach the highest acceptable macronutrient distribution range of 35% for an age/sex group. The highest 95th percentile of protein intake was 20.8% of calories in men aged 51 to 70 years.
          Daily patterns of protein intake among younger and older adults indicate the majority of protein is consumed at dinner (43.0 and 35.8 g, respectively), followed by lunch (25.4 and 20.2 g, respectively), breakfast (11.1 and 13.3 g, respectively), and as snacks (8.8 and 7.2 g, respectively).16 The percentages of total protein intakes derived from animal, dairy, and plant protein were shown to be 46%, 16%, and 30% (8% could not be classified), respectively, among adults 19 years or older enrolled in the NHANES 2007–2010. Chicken and beef were the primary food sources of animal protein intake. Cheese, reduced-fat milk, and ice cream/dairy desserts were the primary sources of dairy protein intake. Yeast breads, rolls/buns, and nuts/seeds were the primary sources of plant-based protein intake.17 Among older individuals enrolled in the NHANES 2005–2006, 5% to 12% of men and 20% to 24% of women were found to be inadequate relative to the current EAR when intakes were adjusted for body weight.18 Researchers should consider adjustment for body weight when assessing protein adequacy as the current DRIs reflect “reference” weights that reflect the median body mass index of the subpopulation of interest.19 Age-related causes of protein shortfall include inadequate intake of dietary protein (eg, loss of appetite), a reduction in the utilization of available protein (eg, anabolic resistance), and a higher basal requirement (eg, increased oxidation of protein and increases in the prevalence of acute and chronic diseases

        <h4>TOTAL PROTEIN INTAKE INCREASES BMD AND REDUCES FRACTURES IN OLDER ADULTS</h4>
        <p class="preview-text"> 
          Bone appears to plateau for a number of years during the third and into the fourth decades of life,23 after which it is gradually lost during middle age to older adulthood (Figure 2).23 An estimated 60% to 80% of the variability in bone mass and osteoporosis risk has been suggested to be explained by heritable lifestyle factors.23 However, there is mounting evidence that older adults need more dietary protein as compared to their younger counterparts to support good health and promote recovery from illness and maintain functionality. For the past 50 years or more, there has been significant controversy over whether higher intakes of dietary protein are beneficial or detrimental to long-term bone health in adults. Since 1920, higher dietary protein intakes have consistently been shown to increase urinary calcium.27,28 Early metabolic balance studies reported that higher protein intakes did not affect intestinal calcium absorption,29–36 suggesting that the additional urinary calcium must be derived from bone tissue. However, contrary to early metabolic balance studies, more recent contemporary and sensitive dual stable calcium isotope studies have found higher protein intakes to increase intestinal calcium absorption, such that the increase in urinary calcium can be accounted for by the improved absorption efficiency.37–39 Four published meta-analyses have attempted to address the longstanding controversy surrounding the effectiveness of dietary protein intake on bone health in adults. Darling et al40 found no effect of higher protein intake on fracture outcomes, whereas the more recent study by Wu et al41 found slight beneficial associations for high versus low intake on hip fracture risk. Shams-White et al42 found a beneficial relationship of high versus low protein intake and BMD and bone mineral content for nearly all bone sites; however, statistical significance was present only at the lumbar spine. Wallace and Frankenfeld43 found that dietary protein intakes above the current RDA (0.8 g/kg per day) may be beneficial in preventing hip fractures (hazard ratio, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.95) after excluding studies that were designed for weight loss, as well as those that did not correct for or exclude those individuals using hormone replacement therapy (HRT), 2 strong drivers of bone density in postmenopausal women with the ability to mask the effects any nutritional intervention. At the very least, contrary to the longstanding hypothesis, these 4 systematic reviews suggest that higher intakes of dietary protein do not have any detrimental effect on bone and may pose a substantial beneficial effect among older adults.40–43 What should dietitians consider when comparing the 2 most recent meta-analyses on dietary protein and bone health? Shams-White et al42 illustrate what we would expect if recommendations around dietary protein intakes were increased globally across the aging population (eg, effects on healthcare cost savings). These data are extremely relevant given that older individuals often substitute other macronutrients for extra protein for various reasons such as weight loss and muscle maintenance. Bone mineral density has been shown to be affected by protein intakes at 24% (ie, 1.1 g/kg per day) versus 18% (0.8 g/kg per day) of total calories. High dietary protein intake may primarily influence trabecular bone loss as compared with a normal protein diet.44 Some postmenopausal women commonly use HRT for treatment of menopause and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis; although the number of women using HRT has greatly decreased over the past decade, older intervention and population studies utilized in systematic reviews still contain significant amounts of women on HRT. Although these 2 factors likely mask the true effect of protein on adult bone, this systematic review gives insight into the population effect of increasing intake recommendations. Wallace and Frankenfeld,43 correcting for these factors, illustrate what is likely to be the real effect of increasing protein intake within an individual patient’s diet. The strengths and limitations of both systematic reviews should be considered in the bone health context.
          </p>


<h4>CONCLUSION</h4>
<p class="preview-text">
  The role of protein appears to be complex and is likely dependent on the presence of other nutrients available in a mixed diet. At the very least, contrary to the longstanding hypothesis, fairly compelling evidence to date suggests that higher intakes of dietary protein do not have any detrimental effect on bone and likely pose a beneficial effect. There is currently no direct evidence of detriment to BMD or fractures resulting from consumption of animal versus plant protein, although evidence is limited because of low intake of plant protein across observational studies and interventions in relation to total protein intake. Diets high in plant-based foods are important for health and disease prevention. However, we should not underscore the importance of animal-derived foods that contribute higher levels of protein (and certain micronutrients), particularly as we age and bone loss becomes more apparent.
