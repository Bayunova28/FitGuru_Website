         <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
         <p class="preview-text">
          The vanilla bean, obtained from Vanilla planifolia and Vanilla tahitensis, members of the Orchidaceae family, is the source of vanilla extract, one of the most desired and widely used food flavorings worldwide. Besides uses of vanilla in foods, perfumes, and pharmaceuticals, it has complementary medicinal applications including alleviation of fever, spasms, and gastrointestinal irritations, to name a few. However, support from the scientific literature for human health benefits of vanilla and its chemical constituents vanillin and vanillic acid is limited and preliminary. This narrative review provides a summary of findings from human and animal studies addressing potential health benefits of the extract of this bean and select extract components.         </p>

         <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
         <p class="preview-text"> 
          The vanilla plant, Vanilla planifolia or Vanilla fragrans (family Orchidaceae), is native to Mexico and is cultivated in numerous sites worldwide, with Indonesia and Madagascar being major sources of production. Vanilla tahitensis and Vanilla pompona are other key species contributing to commercial vanilla production. The green vanilla beans harvested from the plants are essentially odorless and lacking flavor. It is during the curing process of ripening, drying, and conditioning that chemical and enzymatic reactions produce the distinctive flavor and aroma profiles of the different end products. These species provide vanilla products differing in quality and use. For example, V. pompona bean is of lesser quality and used more in the production of fragrances. On the other hand, V. planifolia and V. tahitensis exhibit stronger, more desirable aroma profiles. Vanilla extract is prepared by further macerating cured vanilla pods with a solution of ethanol and water to produce a finished flavoring product that must meet a specific Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standard of identity. Imitation or synthetic vanilla extract is a cheaper food flavoring synthesized from starting chemicals originating from less expensive entities, such as clove oil, spruce tree lignin, and a petrochemical-derived precursor. The price of natural vanilla extract can vary considerably. Practically speaking, retail real vanilla extract could cost several dollars per ounce depending on market forces, whereas imitation vanilla extract could cost several cents per ounce.

          Extracts of the dried bean (Figure 1) are used for a wide assortment of food products. The largest use of vanilla is for ice cream preparations. It has widespread use in enhancing consumer acceptance of yogurt products, and it is added to both alcoholic beverages and soft drinks. Baked goods, such as cookies, brownies, and cakes, contain vanilla, which also flavors syrups, custards, and puddings. For certain limited culinary purposes, natural extracts from V. planifolia may be used. However, for a preponderance of food applications, less expensive imitation extract is used to produce a desired vanilla flavor. In many baked products, for example, imitation and natural vanilla flavors are essentially indistinguishable, especially in those products where vanilla is not intended to be the prominent flavor. As a sweet noncaloric flavoring, vanilla can contribute to strategies to decrease consumer intake of sugars. Extract chemicals also are used for perfumes and pharmaceuticals. The distinctive flavor of vanilla is due to the collective orosensory contribution of a multitude of aromatic volatiles created during processing of the bean. Hundreds of chemicals in the extract have been identified that together participate in crafting this unique flavor profile, although vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) is the main contributor (Figure 2), achieving levels of 1% to 2% wt/wt in cured pods. Additional important flavor components include p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, vanillic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid), p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol, anise alcohol, and vanillyl alcohol, as well as tannins, resins, free amino acids, and other nonvolatiles. Both vanillin and vanillic acid are approved food-flavoring agents. Some traditional medicinal uses of vanilla include treatment for fever, spasms, dysmenorrhea, blood clotting, and gastrointestinal (GI) distress.1–7 In the 18th century bce, vanillin was even used as an Old World mortuary offering.8 More recently, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antisickling, antimicrobial, and hypolipidemic properties of vanilla extract have drawn the attention of the food and nutraceutical industries.9–15 Currently, there is a general lack of research data on this area of nutrition. In light of preliminary findings to date, there is a need for a more systematic approach to exposing any health benefits by examining vanilla's possible biological actions in animal models and humans. This narrative review outlines the emerging research on vanilla, providing direction for systematic research building the evidence base for potential human health benefits.

        <h4>METHODS
        </h4>

        <p class="preview-text"> 
          A search of the PubMed and Science Direct databases was conducted using terms that included Vanilla planifolia, Vanilla tahitensis, Vanilla pompona, vanilla, vanillin, vanillic acid, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, and 4-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid. Full reports of English-language publications and English-language abstracts of foreign-language articles from peer-reviewed journals that specifically address animal and human studies were the primary sources of information. Although the quality of studies varied considerably, all published investigations identified were included in this overview so that the totality and diversity of information can be described, and issues for future research can be identified. Additional information was gleaned from bibliographies within these sources. Studies examining vanilla within multi-ingredient preparations were not included in this overview.          
          </p>


          <h4>SAFETY</h4>
          <p class="preview-text">
            Through the centuries, cultural uses of vanilla were numerous including as a flavoring constituent, fragrance ingredient, and medicinal agent. Vanilla extract, oil, seed powder, and vanillin are considered generally recognized as safe by the US FDA for use as spices and other natural seasonings and flavorings in food (section 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 CFR 182.10; 21 CFR 182.60;CFR582.10]). Vanillic acid is approved as a food flavoring by the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives, number 959.134 Rats provided dietary vanillin at levels of 20 and 50 g/kg diet for 1 and 2 years, respectively, exhibited no effects on growth, hematology, and tissue pathologies.135 Similarly, Ho et al66 dosed rats p.o. and i.g. with vanillin (150 and 300 mg/kg) for 14 weeks without detecting toxicities. These results are consistent with others,86–88 indicating a lack of toxicity of vanilla components at approved levels of intake in foods. In contrast, rats fed vanillin (1.25 g/kg diet, 42 days) in a study showed decreased growth and lower blood and liver activities of glutathione-S-transferase and SOD, compared with controls. The reason for this latter response to vanillin compared with the other reports is not known.

In humans, isolated adverse events include bronchoconstriction in an asthmatic patient following oral doses of either 0.24 mg or 1 mg vanillin.137 Occupational contact dermatitis to vanilla was reported for producers of baked goods, and contact dermatitis resulted from use of a vanilla lip salve. Dermatitis due to mechanical irritation of vanillin dust also was observed.138,139 Anaphylaxis was noted following ingestion of vanilla ice cream, the specific cause of which, however, was determined to be due to lupine added to the ice cream.140 Variable responses to skin sensitization tests have been reported in several case reports.141

The capacity of vanillin and vanillic acid to interact with drugs and hormones was examined in vitro. In a rat muscle L6 myotube assay, a model system to study glucose transporter type 4 glucose uptake, vanillic acid showed additive enhancement of 2-deoxyglucose uptake stimulated by 2,4-thiozoladinedione, compared with controls, whereas it did not demonstrate synergy with metformin dosing.142 In cell culture, vanillic acid also inhibited the activity of human organic ion transporter 1,143 which is a member of a transporter family that participates in the distribution and kidney clearance of many endogenous and exogenous organic ions. The clinical relevance of this is unclear. In microsomal assays and cell culture, vanillin was reported to interact with drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2E1 and CYP1A2144 and to reverse multidrug resistance via inhibition of P-glycoprotein.145 Also, it was reported to have no effect on the metabolism of phenylephrine, a hypotensive drug metabolized by the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which removes certain neurotransmitters from the brain.146 In 2 other in vitro studies, vanillin was determined not to be an endocrine disruptor.147,148 Of related interest, vanillin was observed in vitro to inhibit nonenzymatic glycation of albumin, suggesting it has the potential to block the formation of advanced glycation end products.149

        <h4>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p class="preview-text"> 
          
          Although support from the scientific literature for use of vanilla to impart human health benefits is preliminary and limited, there is emerging research suggesting that specific vanilla constituents may potentially help improve symptoms of several chronic conditions. Small clinical studies suggest that olfactory exposure to vanillin may sooth and calm distressed infants and diminish sleep apnea in infants and adults. Use of this mode of vanillin exposure to accrue human benefits, however, requires clarification of practical aspects of implementation and needs more research to characterize the complex emotional and physiological responses involved. In animal models, preliminary findings suggest vanillin and vanillic acid have potential to alleviate neurological disorders, dysregulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis, and cardiac distress, in particular. Considerable additional characterization of these physiological actions is needed and includes clarifying their mechanisms of action and establishing an oral dose-response relationship. The small amounts of vanilla currently consumed as a flavoring in foods make any practical human health benefits from culinary uses unlikely at this point.          </p>
