         <h4>ABSTRACT</h4>
         <p class="preview-text">
          It is the position of the Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior that environmental sustainability should be inherent in dietary guidance, whether working with individuals or groups about their dietary choices or in setting national dietary guidance. Improving the nutritional health of a population is a long-term goal that requires ensuring the long-term sustainability of the food system. Current environmental trends, including those related to climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, water shortages, and water pollution, threaten long-term food security and are caused in part by current diets and agricultural practices. Addressing these problems while producing more food for a growing population will require changes to current food systems. Dietary choices have a significant role in contributing to environmental impacts, which could be lessened by consuming fewer overconsumed animal products and more plant-based foods while reducing excess energy intake and the amount of food wasted. Discussion of sus- tainability within governmental dietary guidance is common in many countries, is consistent with previous US guide- lines, and is within the scope of authorizing legislation. Dietary choices are a personal matter, but many American consumers are motivated by a concern for the environment and would welcome sound advice from credentialed nutrition professionals. More opportunities are needed for developing such interdisciplinary knowledge among nutritionists.

         <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
         <p class="preview-text"> 
          It is the position of the Society for Nutri- tion Education and Behavior (SNEB) that environmental  sustainability should be inherent in dietary guidance, whether working with individuals or groups about their dietary choices or in setting national dietary guidance. Improving the nutritional health of a population is a long-term goal that requires ensuring the long-term sustainability of the food system. In  early 2015, the Dietary Guidelines.
          Advisory Committee1 (DGAC), a committee of experts charged with developing dietary guidance for the US population, released their scien- tific advisory report to the Secretaries of Agriculture and Health and Human Services. The DGAC devoted a section to the issue of food sustain- ability, defining a sustainable diet as “a pattern of eating that promotes health and well-being and provides food security for the present population while sustaining human and natural resources for future
          generations.”1 Based on existing evi- dence, the DGAC asserted that  a  diet  higher  in  plant-based  foods and lower in animal-based foods is healthier and associated with a lower environmental impact than the cur- rent U.S. diet, and that this could be achieved without excluding any food groups.1 However, the final Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA),2 pro- duced by the US Department of Agri- culture (USDA) and the Department of Health and Human Services, make no mention of this issue. This raises  a series of questions the current
          authors attempt to address in this
          article: Should we, as a society, care about the environmental sustainabil- ity of the food system? Does what we eat have a significant impact on the environment? Is dietary guidance compatible with efforts to promote such sustainability? Why was the DGAC discussion on sustainability not included? In answering these questions, this article lays out the scientific rationale for the SNEB’s position statement. After a brief description of current environmental
          problems, the article discusses the challenges faced in meeting future food needs and the recent science behind assessing the environmental impacts of foods and diets. A subse- quent section discusses sustainability and dietary guidance in this country and others and some specific recom- mendations for dietary guidance and research. Throughout this article, the authors focus on the environmental dimension of sustainability rather than its health, social, or economic dimensions. It is vitally important to consider these other dimensions of sustainability but they are beyond  the scope of this article.

        <h4>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF TOTAL DIETS</h4>

        <p class="preview-text"> 

          A number of authors combined results from individual LCA studies to develop databases of environmen- tal impacts. Much of this work was motivated by the goal of evaluating complete diets. For example, a data- base of the GHGE from food was developed for use in the United King- dom.55 The environmental impacts
 
of diets were also studied in France,56 Germany,57 and the Nordic coun- tries.58 In the US, several teams com- piled food LCA studies to evaluate complete diets.59—61

        <h4>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION</h4>
        <p class="preview-text"> 
          People want to know what to eat today, so it is incumbent on those of us who are knowledgeable about nutritional science and education techniques to provide the best advice based on the available evidence to date. Clearly this advice might change as nuances in the science are discovered and resolved. To the credit of those who formulated the initial legislation authorizing the DGA, they required publication of a report at least every 5 years for pre- cisely this reason.
 
          The best science we have today makes it clear that current environ- mental problems, including global climate       change,3,7      biodiversity
          loss,10—15 land degradation,16 water shortages,17 and water pollution18,19 demand urgent attention, threaten long-term food security, and are in
          part caused by current food choices and	agricultural
          practices.20,21,24—26,32,34,37—42
          Addressing these problems while pro- ducing more food for the growing population will require changes to the food systems.20,21,24—26,32,34,37—42 Dietary choices have a significant role in contributing to environmen- tal impacts. These impacts could be lessened by choosing fewer overcon- sumed animal products, particularly
          food from ruminant animals, includ- ing more plant-based foods, and reducing excess calorie consumption and wasted food.20,32,37—42
          Taken together, the science on
          environmental impacts of food  choices and diet has several implica- tions for policy, practice, and future research. First, federal dietary guide- lines should include environmental sustainability considerations. Second, nutrition advisors and educators can convey both the health and environ- mental benefits of dietary choices. Finally, more research is needed on changing consumer behavior regard- ing sustainable diets and on various topics related to the LCA of foods, including studies on a wider variety of foods with a greater number of envi- ronmental impacts and on more foods produced in the US
